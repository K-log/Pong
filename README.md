# Pong
Pong written in Python with pygame.

In order to play the game put both the instruction.png and game.py in the same folder and run game.py with python.

The game supports two players and the instructions can be found in-game.

Note: The game is poorly optimized and doesnt have a way to reset it so you must restart the script in order to reset.
